  abstract = {A general software system for construction, editing and optimization
	of Markov decision processes ranging from traditional models and
	hierarchical Markov processes to multi-level hierarchical processes
	is presented. The software is designed to be multipurpose, to meet
	the needs of students and young scientists for demonstration of methods
	and concepts as well as the needs of a professional user, building
	real world models. A short description of the system is given and
	its facilities are illustrated through a sow model defined as a three-level
	hierarchical Markov process combining decisions on two time scales.
	Emphasis is put on modeling devices that may simplify the structure
	or speed up the calculations, which in real world models are of vast
	dimensions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  title = {Multi-level hierarchic {M}arkov processes as a framework for herd
	management support},
  journal = {Annals of Operations Research},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {94},
  pages = {69--89},
  abstract = {A general problem in relation to application of Markov decision processes
	to real world problems is the curse of dimensionality, since the
	size of the state space grows to prohibitive levels when information
	on all relevant traits of the system being modeled are included.
	In herd management, we face a hierarchy of decisions made at different
	levels with different time horizons, and the decisions made at different
	levels are mutually dependent. Furthermore, decisions have to be
	made without certainty about the future state of the system. These
	aspects contribute even further to the dimensionality problem. A
	new notion of a multi-level hierarchic Markov process specially designed
	to solve dynamic decision problems involving decisions with varying
	time horizon has been presented. The method contributes significantly
	to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, and it provides a framework
	for general herd management support instead of very specialized models
	only concerned with a single decision as, for instance, replacement.
	The applicational perspectives of the technique are illustrated by
	potential examples relating to the management of a sow herd and a
	dairy herd.},

  title = {Finding the {$K$} best policies in a finite-horizon {M}arkov decision
	process},
  journal = {European Journal of Operational Research},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {175},
  pages = {1164--1179},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Directed hypergraphs represent a general modelling and algorithmic
	tool, which have been successfully used in many different research
	areas such as artificial intelligence, database systems, fuzzy systems,
	propositional logic and transportation networks. However, modelling
	Markov decision processes using directed hypergraphs has not yet
	been considered. \par In this paper we consider finite-horizon Markov
	decision processes (MDPs) with finite state and action space and
	present an algorithm for finding the K best policies. That is, we
	are interested in ranking the first K policies in non-decreasing
	order using an additive criterion of optimality. The algorithm uses
	a directed hypergraph to model the finite-horizon MDP. It is shown
	that the problem of finding the optimal policy can be formulated
	as a minimum weight hyperpath problem and be solved in linear time,
	with respect to the input data representing the MDP, using different
	additive optimality criteria.},
