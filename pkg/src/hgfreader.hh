/** Class for reading/loading directed hypergraphs.

Format "f 6" is needed for reading the text file. Hypergraph "f 6" format is
defined as:

    - Comments can be inserted using # at the top of the file, i.e. the rest of the line will be ignored.
    - First line (not including comments) must consist of \n
    f 6 <nodes> <arcs> <harcs> <max tail size of hyperarcs>
    <total number of nodes in true hyperarcs>
    <number of weights> <number of multipliers in each tail>

    ex: f6 100 30 120 5 2000 2 1

    All numbers must be integer.

    - <arcs>+<harcs> lines follows next.

A line describe a hyperarc if contains:

    <head> <tail nodes (negative)> 0 <weights> <mulitipliers>

    ex: 2 -4 -5 -8 0 20 40 60 230 2323

  The tail nodes are separated with space and written with a minus sign.
  Multipliers are integers ordered such that first comes the multipliers in
  tail one, then tail two and so fourth. All numbers must be integers except the
  weights. Note multipliers are not normalized. Important: Nodes must be
  numbered from 1!

A line describe an arc if contains

    <head> <tail node (negative)> 0 <weights>

    ex: 2 -8 0 2340 2323

  The tail nodes are separated with space and written with a minus sign.
  Multipliers are integers ordered such that first comes the multipliers in
  tail one, then tail two and so fourth. All numbers must be integers except the
  weights. Note multipliers are not normalized. Important: Nodes must be
  numbered from 1!

No order of the (hyper)arcs are assumed.

Example:

# Example hypergraph f 6 format
#
#    f 6 <nodes> <arcs> <harcs> <max tail size of hyperarcs>
#    <total number of nodes in true hyperarcs>
#    <number of multipliers in each tail> <number of weights>
#
f 6 4 1 1 3 4 3 1
1 -4 0 2 5 7
1 -2 -3 -4 0 1 2 3 10 15 20
